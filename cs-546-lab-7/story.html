            One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter.
            After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore .
            The wise man smiled and said: Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy.
